# The Harbinger

A simple little game made for [theBatya Game Jam 2021.2](https://itch.io/jam/thebatya-game-jam-2021-2/rate/1168619).

It is a 2D top-down real-time adventure game without any special mechanics, but it contains some notable features, such as:

- Character sprite animations (for several states);
- Chat log;
- Quick Time Events;  
- Settings menu (git version only);
- Translation (git version only);
- Navigation hints (git version only).

All the assets were created by me, except for the font - Comic Sans MS Pixel. Copyright: JustAngelSQ 2017 “Sans” by “Ryan Brotherston”.
